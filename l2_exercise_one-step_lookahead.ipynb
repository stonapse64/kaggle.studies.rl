You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.  In order to be marked correct, \n- your agent must win at least half of the games, and\n- `C` and `D` must both be nonzero.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Assign your values here\nA = 100\nB = 2\nC = 1\nD = -1\nE = -10\n\n# Check your answer (this will take a few seconds to run!)\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_1.hint()\n# q_1.solution()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Does the agent win?\n\nConsider the game board below.  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/AlnaQ3J.png\" width=30%><br/>\n</center>\n\nSay the agent uses red discs, and it's the agent's turn.  \n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_from the tutorial_**, does it win or lose the game?\n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_that you just implemented_**, does it win or lose the game?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#q_2.hint()\n#agent with heuristic from tutorial has a 50% to win as it will make a random choice between col 0 and 6 \n#agent with heuristic just implemented will win as a drop in col 6 will create a negative score whereas a drop in col 0 will have a score of zero","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-30T18:27:34.468728Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-30T18:27:34.469123Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-30T18:27:34.476386Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-30T18:27:34.469095Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-30T18:27:34.475379Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"2_BothLose\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: The agent has two choices: it can play in either column 0 (the leftmost column), or column 6 (the rightmost column).
